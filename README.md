# Moa, an image downloader for iOS/Swift

## Usage

```Swift
imageView.moa.url = "http://evgenii.com/bacteria.jpg"
```

Setting `moa.url` will trigger the image download.
The downloaded image will be assigned to the image view upon completion.

## Cancelling download

Ongoing image download for the UIImageView is automatically cancelled when:

1. Image view is deallocated.
2. New image download is started: `imageView.moa.url = ...`.

To manually cancel the download: `imageView.moa.cancel()`

## Using placeholder image

Placeholder is shown in the beginning and then replaced by the downloaded image.

```Swift
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "placeholder.jpg")
imageView.moa.url = "http://evgenii.com/octopus.jpg"
```

## Using error image

If you supply an error image it will be show if downloads fails.

```Swift
imageView.moa.errorImage = UIImage(named: "error.jpg")
imageView.moa.url = "http://evgenii.com/ant.jpg"
```


## Advanced features

### Supplying completion closure

Assign a closure to `willCompleteDownloadAsync` property before setting `imageView.moa.url` property.
The close will be called asynchronously after download has been complete and before the image
is assigned to the image view. The clusure's return value is an image that will be assigned to the
image view. No image will be assigned if the returned value is `nil`.

```Swift
imageView.moa.didFinishDownoadAsync = { image, isSuccessful in
  return image
}

imageView.moa.url = "http://evgenii.com/ant.jpg"
```

### Download image without UIImageView

An instance of `Moa` class can also be used without an image view.

```Swift
let moa = Moa()
moa.didFinishDownoadAsync = { image, isSuccessful in
  return image
}
moa.url = "http://evgenii.com/moa.jpg"
```
